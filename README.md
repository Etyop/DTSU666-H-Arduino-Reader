# DTSU666-H-Arduino-Reader
This project uses an Arduino Mega to read a Modbus RTU feed through RS485. This example is based on a Huawei / CHINT DTSU666-H.

You can get the list of all possible variables to get from the DTSU666-H in following Excel file : https://github.com/salakrzy/DTSU666_CHINT_to_HUAWEI_translator/blob/main/doc/CHINT%20HUAWEI%20address%20remapping.xlsx
