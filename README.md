# DTSU666-H-Arduino-Reader
This project uses an Arduino Mega to read a Modbus RTU feed through RS485. This example is based on a Huawei / CHINT DTSU666-H.

You can get the list of all possible variables to get from the DTSU666-H in the Excel file. Source : https://github.com/salakrzy/DTSU666_CHINT_to_HUAWEI_translator/tree/main/doc
